wofs provides a write only filesystem with naming restriction.
Usage : wofs -o options mount_point
  - dir=storage_directory directory where the files will be written.
  - conf=configuration_directory directory containing allow.rules and deny.rules.
From the mount point, one can only create directories and write files.
Attempt to read a file fail with permission denied.
Attempt to read a directory returns no file.
Unfortunately one can know if a file or a directory exist if he knows its name. But nothing can be read out of it.
The configuration files allow.rules and deny.rules contains one regular expression per line.
File or directory creation will be allowed only if its path match an allowed rule.
File or directory creation will be denied if its path match a denied rule.
